		<p> ....I think I might have a problem with OP characters (OP = overpowered you uncultured swines) (and no, it didn't come from anime so don't use that as an excuse). What's there not to love about a quiet, NOT shy, sarcastic character who's not afraid to put someone in their place? Hah, classic. </p>
		<br> <br> 

		<p> Contrary to the past two comedic, character developement, and hits-deep-in-the-feels shows before, this is something completely different. I'm just going to say it now that this is a war-loving, killing-crazed, child devil. If that triggeres any flags for you, I suggest you don't watch this (much less read the manga). </p>
		<br> <br> 

		<p> In modern Japanese, there's this one salesmanager. He's strict, smart, sharp, and...a big too logically based. If someone simply isn't working enough to benefit the company, fire them. If the upper bosses order him to cut an employee off, despite any circumstances that usually would trigger a heart string or two, he'll get it done. </p>
		<br> <br> 

		<p> If you can't tell, he doesn't believe in God. That's until a former fired employee kills him and God stops time, shaming him for not believing in the supreme being. So, the said supreme being reincarnates him all the way back in WWI. He's reborned as orphaned baby who has all his memories in tact. Except, this world is a tiny bit differnt. The main character is targetted by God, being given the worst circumstances and unlucky incidents you can ever imagine. God keeps toying with the human world, furiously trying to turn him into a believer. So, what do you do when you're targetted by some being you don't believe in during the middle of a war? You join it. </p>
