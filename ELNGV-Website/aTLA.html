		<p> So, this is not an anime. I repeat, this is not an anime. The entire anime and ATLA fandom will come for you if you call it one. Why? An anime is an animation FROM Japan. If you didn't already know, ATLA is an American show (based off of on-going comic books). However, I am mentioning it in my list of "Anime Recs" because ATLA is just that good. </p>
		<br> <br> 

		<p> This show (and the comics) have got to be one of the best made pieces of media ever, mixing somedy, dark humor, mental issues, betrayal, love, and all of the above. Starting off with the characters, each individual has their own complex fights that are shown wonderfully throughout the entire storyline. Their actions and thoughts reflect their inner turmoil, but as they move on with their lives and goal, the people around them change each other - and they change, too.</p>
		<br> <br> 

		<p> For the better or the worse. </p>
		<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

		<p> The entire plot takes place in a world with benders - elemental benders. There are four main elements: water, earth, fire, and air. (In that particular order). There are of course deviants, like water to blood, earth to sand, fire to lighting, and air to energy. (Yes, there are more). </p>
		<br><br>

		<p> The avatar, the only person in the universe who is capable of bending all the elements and deviants, is kind of the "hero" or "peacemaker" in the world. He reincarnates every time he dies, and the souls of the past avatars are kept in the spirit world (yes, there is a spirit world). He avatar disappeared for 100 years, and during that time, the fire nation began their attack. Their tyranny killed every single last airbender - execpt the avatar. Now, two southern water tribe members, a waterbender sister and nonbender brother, found the avatar one day. Watch as their fates intertwine and meet the fated ones in their lives. </p>
