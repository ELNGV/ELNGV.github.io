		<p> Assassination Classroom will and I mean will bring you in for a ride. I mean, the name itself is cool, right? This anime with loveable characters show off each of their unique traits (albeit disliking each other first), learn to work together as one, mix in touching life lessons, badass action, and an unkillable teacher. What more can be said? </p>
		<br> <br>

		<p> This anime, along with its manga, hits deep. In a school where the lowest students with each their own problems are put in Class 3-E are are greatly discriminated against, they have lost hope. That is until an octopus human (?),who blew up 70% of the moon, replaces their teacher. Keeping this a secret from the entire world but its top officials, the students of class 3-E make a deal with the Japanese gonvernemnt - graduate middle school, and kill their teacher. </p>
		<br> <br>

		<p> Nothing hard, right? </p>
